# latex-textbook
A template for a science, engineering or mathematics textbook in LaTeX. Supports references within the textbook, to an external website, or to an accompanying PDF document. Support for code, math equations, exercises, and optional solutions. Uses modern LaTeX libraries and includes (a few) examples. Makefile supports Windows, Linux and Mac.

This template is drived from Jensen, Lee & Seshia - An Introductory Lab in Embedded and Cyber-Physical Systems, which itself derives from Lee & Seshia - Introduction to Embedded Systems. See http://leeseshia.org.
